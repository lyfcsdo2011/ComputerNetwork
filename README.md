## 1 Developing a simple C/S Text Transmission program based on SOCKET
By C, VS 2010.

Why? Because we are asked to use it in one of our experiments...

Develop a program based on TCP/IP protocol SOCKET, Client can send text from the standard input,

and the server can receive and display it on the standard output.

## 2 Concurrent Server
BY Python.

On the basis of experiments 1, using the concurrent server mode, realize the server applet or app.  

Clients can send text, message, picture audio or video files concurrently to server.

You need to cross compile the codes on Linux to generate apk.

Choose the correct SDK and NDK. (I generated, but they can't run on my Android 10!)
